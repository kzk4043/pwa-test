Required Specifications:
- Size: 512x512 pixels
- Format: PNG
- Purpose: maskable any
- Color depth: 24-bit or 32-bit (with transparency)

Design Guidelines:
- This is the largest and highest quality icon size for PWAs
- Used for splash screens, app stores, and the highest resolution displays
- Design should be extremely detailed and pixel-perfect
- Ensure the icon works well with rounded corners and masks
- For "maskable any" purpose, the central 80% of the icon should contain the important visual elements
- The outer 20% (safe zone) may be cropped by the system
- Use solid background or ensure transparency works well with various backgrounds
- Consider the theme color (#2196F3) and background color (#ffffff) from manifest.json
- This is often the master icon from which all other sizes are generated

Recommended Tools:
- Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop
- Figma
- GIMP (free alternative)
- Online PWA icon generators
